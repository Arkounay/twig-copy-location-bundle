# Twig Copy Location Bundle

This just adds the current twig filename in the debug bar, and allows you to copy its path. Also adds the current controller name and path.

Useful when you need to navigate quickly and want to quickly go to the current controller or the current twig, just to copy the file's path in your IDE, search by file, paste, and you're done.
